To Do:<br>
! Figure out CORS policy errors ! <br>
•Get Wi-Fi to actually do internet stuff<br>
•Make the submit button actually set new plants in the database. Step 1: retrieve prefs of name from plantprefs Step 2: set currentplant name and prefs.<br>
>If Custom, set plantprefs name = inputName where prefuv = -1, and plantprefs pref__stat__ where name="custom"<br>

•add more plant types to MySQL and update index.html to include them as options in the dropdown object<br>
•Make the plant prefs correct. Right now they're just placeholders<br>
