                <p style = "font-size: x-large;"><strong>Why a smart garden?<strong></p>
                <p class = "para">As inflation in the United States continues to rise, and global supply chain issues persist, working class people are finding it harder and harder to be able to find or afford healthy food options at their local grocery stores. The looming fear of large-scale food scarcity coupled with the steadily declining economy have forced many Americans to turn to unhealthy food alternatives. The smart garden presents a small but impactful way to help counteract this issue and benefit the lives of those in need. Our goal in creating this product doesnâ€™t stop at financially benefiting the lives of the people who use it. The SMART Garden serves as a way to better the health of the individual, both physically and mentally. </p>
