                <p style = "font-size: x-large;"><strong>Why a smart garden?<strong></p>
                <p class = "para">As inflation in the United States continues to rise, and global supply chain issues persist, working class people are finding it harder and harder to be able to find or afford healthy food options at their local grocery stores. The looming fear of large-scale food scarcity coupled with the steadily declining economy have forced many Americans to turn to unhealthy food alternatives. The smart garden presents a small but impactful way to help counteract this issue and benefit the lives of those in need. Our goal in creating this product doesnâ€™t stop at financially benefiting the lives of the people who use it. The SMART Garden serves as a way to better the health of the individual, both physically and mentally. </p>
            <br>

                <p style = "font-size: x-large;"><strong>What is  a smart garden?<strong></p>
                <p class = "para">A smart garden is a garden that can automatically care for your plants, very often with some connection to an 'internet of things', allowing you to configure it wirelessly. Ours does this by letting you select the ideal conditions for your plant and monitoring the soil moisture of the garden's soil. If the soil is too dry, the pumps are activated and the plant is watered. With the garden connected to Wi-Fi, it will automatically retrieve the latest ideal values from our website and upate it with the most recent sensor readings. You can view the soil moisture, humidity, and temperature of the garden from anywhere, all while being sure your plant receives only as much water as it needs. </p>
